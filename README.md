# SLIIT GPA Calculator

A modern, user-friendly GPA calculator designed specifically for undergraduates at the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT). This tool helps you calculate your Semester GPA (SGPA) and Weighted Cumulative GPA (CGPA) instantly, supporting all faculties and departments.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Support**: Covers all SLIIT faculties:
  - Faculty of Computing
  - Faculty of Engineering
  - SLIIT Business School
  - Faculty of Humanities & Sciences
  - School of Architecture
  - (Topup Courses provided by SLIIT and courses that are made with partnerships with foreign universities may not be included in the database).
- **Smart Calculations**:
  - Calculates **SGPA** based on module credits and grades.
  - Calculates **Weighted CGPA** according to faculty-specific weighting rules.
  - **Faculty of Computing Logic**: Accurately handles different weighting for IT streams (where Year 1 courses may not impact CGPA) vs. CS/CSE streams (where Year 1 courses contribute 10% to CGPA), as per the 2025 Student Handbook and departmental standards.
- **Detailed Breakdown**: View your performance semester-by-semester.
- **Dean's List Recognition**: Automatically detects if you've made the Dean's List (GPA ≥ 3.7) and celebrates with an animation!
- **Motivational Feedback**: Provides encouraging messages based on your calculated GPA to keep you motivated.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Dark Mode**: Respects your system preference for light or dark themes.

## Calculation Notes

- **Faculty of Computing (CS/CSE courses)**: While the general handbook may not explicitly detail the weighting for Computer Science and Computer Systems Engineering, this calculator applies a 10% contribution from Year 1 to the final CGPA, reflecting current academic department standards verified by students.
- **General Estimation**: All calculations are estimates based on the available module credits and grading systems. Official results may vary slightly due to specific academic regulations not covered here.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Semantic structure and accessibility.
- **CSS**: Custom styling with responsive layouts and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic for dynamic data loading, GPA calculation, and UI interactions.
- **JSON**: Data storage for faculty modules, credits, and degree structures.

## Local Development

Since this project relies on fetching local JSON files, modern browsers will block these requests if you simply open `index.html` directly. You must run a local web server.
